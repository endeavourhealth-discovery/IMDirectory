            which is licensed under Apache 2.0 and can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/endeavourhealth-discovery/uprn-match">here</a>. The current

            This algorithm was developed by David Stables with the support of the Endeavour Health Charity, and by Gill Harper and Carol Dezateux, Queen Mary,
            University of London, with the support of funding from Barts Charity and OneLondon. It was also supported by Health Data Research UK, an initiative
            funded by UK Research and Innovation, Department of Health and Social Care (England) and the devolved administrations, and leading medical research
            charities. This product also includes an API developed by Learning Health Solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium is used by the algorithm as the source of Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs), made available to the
            developers by the Ordnance Survey Public Sector Geospatial Agreement.

          <p>
            The Discovery Programme Address Matching Algorithm has been developed to give a deterministic match to the best estimate Ordnance Survey AddressBase
            Premium Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) of where a person lives based on their NHS patient recorded address. To facilitate this, only UPRNs
            with relevant residential property classification codes in Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium are matched to by the algorithm. Documentation of the
            method can be found <a href="https://wiki.discoverydataservice.org/index.php?title=UPRN_address_matching_algorithm#Best_fit_ranking">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm has evolved throughout its development and has been quality assured against gold standard datasets to calculate error rates and
            evaluated for bias in non-matches. The quality of the UPRN match is also dependent on the quality of the input address and the quality and
            completeness of Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium, of which the Discovery Programme has no control.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UPRN match is assigned a qualifier that indicates how close a match the assigned UPRN is considered to be based on the format of the patient
            address supplied.
          </p>

          <p>
            The algorithm error rates and description of match qualifiers can also be found

          <p>
            The user should be aware of the aforementioned caveats and how they might affect the particular purpose for which they intend to use the assigned
            UPRNs. The code developers, their organisations and funders, and the Discovery Programme bear no responsibility for the implementation, use,
            analysis or interpretation of outputs derived from its use.
